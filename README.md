# pongchat
A website where players interact by playing the famous game pong and chatting.

This project was an attempt to learn about real time online gaming and web sockets.  I believe both of those goals were accomplished.  In this project I used Node.js, Express, and Socket.io to create an online version of pong, with the added ability to send your opponent messages.  To make the game playable online despite network latency and lag, I used the techniques of client-prediction, interpolation, and lag compensation.  These techniques are described in detail in the websites that I used to learn them:

To test the multiplayer capabilities, open the game in two separate tabs.
